# SalonSavvy
My good friend Nancy opened Salon Savvy a couple of years ago. As an avid photographer, I have and continue to shoot all of her website and social media photos. Nancy has often voiced her frustration over how long it took for her webmaster to post photos of new technicians on her web site, sometimes taking several weeks. Nancy also mentioned that she wished she could find a better way to fill the void of last-minute customer cancellations. I built this website in an effort to address these two problems.


My goals for this site are to incorporate the existing Salon Savvy branding while creating pages that are aesthetically pleasing, and to add functionality that will allow Nancy to keep her technician information current and improve customer traffic.
